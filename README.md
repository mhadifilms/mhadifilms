## ðŸ‘‹ Hey, I'm M Hadi

I'm a Bay Area-based filmmaker who's been creating content online for over seven years. I love experimenting with technology and finding small ways to automate everyday menial tasks, and on here is where you'll find the results of my experiments. I try my best to make sure every "experiment" functions at least to a basic level before sharing as a public repository, however if you ever encounter any issues I'm always open to revisiting and old experiment to improve it.

Some of my favorite experiments include:
- A font finding app that replaces the standard MacOS Font Book application and has potential for a lot more functionality
- A simple web app that generates prayer times as an .ics file for you to import directly into your calendar
- A replacement for Premiere Pro's (horrible) subtitling thats way more accurate and gives more customization
- A fork of another repo for moving from YouTube to Spotify, that I've added better logic for + turned into a Chrome extension that lets you save any song directly from your focused tab to Spotify
- Lots more in the works :)
