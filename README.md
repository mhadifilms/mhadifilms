## 👋 Hey, I'm M Hadi

I've been a filmmaker for the past seven years, exploring the boundaries of creativity through the latest technology. I believe in the [power of prototyping with AI](https://open.substack.com/pub/mhadimedia/p/building-an-app-every-day-but-idk) to assist the creative process. Below, I've compiled some of my favorite eexperiments. Some are half-baked, and some never made it past a simple prototype. But the beauty is in the ability to have a prototype rather than just an idea lost in a notes app somewhere. Feel free to play around, copy, tweak, and experiment with any of the repos below - and if you have any ideas for how to 

[Arc Exporter](https://github.com/mhadifilms/arc-exporter): Switch to and from Arc Browser to Chrome, Zen, or Firefox... RIP Arc :(
[Cropaway](https://github.com/mhadifilms/cropaway): A lightweight Mac desktop app for cropping and segmenting videos with simple video or bounding box export (supports AI tracking)
[Framedotso](https://github.com/mhadifilms/framedotso): A Frame.io alternative that connects directly to S3 and lives locally as an Electron app (requires proxy versions to exist on S3)
[Clean Subtitles](https://github.com/mhadifilms/Clean-Subtitles): A very simple subtitling tool that has the same features as Premiere Pro's auto transcription, but with higher accuracy and more customization (including lowercase subtitles)
[Save to Spotify](https://github.com/mhadifilms/SavetoSpotify): A Chrome extension that allows you to easily save music from any site to a Spotify playlist of choice
[Fontiac](https://github.com/mhadifilms/fontiac): Electron-based alternative to the built in Font Book Mac app, with more customization and AI grouping
[sheetsync](https://github.com/mhadifilms/sheetsync): Mac menu bar app to any Google sheet locally as an XLSX/CSV/JSON with backups and conflict resolution
